# Movie Ticket Price Comparison

## Movies API:

There are 2 API operations available for 2 popular movie databases, cinema world and film world.

/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movies : This returns the movies that are available
/api/{cinemaworld or filmworld}/movie/{ID}: This returns the details of a single movie

To access this API you'll require an API token.

Also just like any real world API these may be flaky at times.

## Exercise:

Build a web app to allow customers to get the cheapest price for movies from these two providers in a timely manner.

Design a solution to have a functioning app when not all of the providers are functioning at 100 %.

Feel free to make and document any assumptions you have made.

The API token provided to you should not be exposed to the public.
